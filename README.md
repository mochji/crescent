### this is in development!!!

this is heavily inspired from lua (which is why its called crescent), and will be similar to lua in both the syntax and c api with stuff i believe can be improved (and isnt absolutely painful to read the surce code)

this is mostly a hyperfixation that became too large

#### done

 - object structure
 - stack and call structure
 - basic c api
 - opcodes
 - string type

#### donen't

 - array type
 - table type
 - globals
 - metatables/metamethods
 - vm
 - lexer, parser, anything related to the compiler
 - aux library
 - base libs (base, math, io, os, string, etc)
