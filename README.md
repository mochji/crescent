### this is in development!!!

crescent will be an interpreted programming language written in c, drawing inspiration from lua in both it's syntax and its internal structure

in a technical sense you might consider this a fork but i dont really think so. even though its similar to lua's internal structure:
 - its from scratch
 - its still differs internally in ways
 - the langauge itself will evolve to be different from lua in both its features and syntax most likely
